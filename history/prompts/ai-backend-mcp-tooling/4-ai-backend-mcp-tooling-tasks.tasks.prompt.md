## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the AI Backend & MCP Tooling feature. The tasks.md file includes:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks including data models and infrastructure
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (Natural Language Todo Management) with MVP focus
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (Secure Multi-User Access) with security enhancements
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (Conversation Continuity) with persistence features
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story while maintaining proper dependencies.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created for AI-powered chat backend with MCP tooling
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md in specs/001-ai-backend-mcp-tooling/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story for independent development
