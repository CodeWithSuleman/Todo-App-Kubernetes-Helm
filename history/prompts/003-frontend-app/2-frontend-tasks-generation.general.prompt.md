## Prompt

Create a PHR for the frontend application tasks generation work that was just completed. The PHR should be stored in the history/prompts/003-frontend-app/ directory with an appropriate filename and should document the tasks creation process.

## Response snapshot

I'll create a PHR for the frontend application tasks generation work. First, I need to check if there's a PHR template and then create the appropriate PHR file.

[Response continues with the PHR creation process...]

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documentation for frontend tasks generation work in the proper directory structure
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created history/prompts/003-frontend-app/2-frontend-tasks-generation.general.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with frontend implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper PHR documentation helps maintain traceability of development decisions
