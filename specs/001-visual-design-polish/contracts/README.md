# API Contracts: Visual Design, UI Polish & Motion

This feature is focused purely on frontend visual enhancements and does not introduce any new API endpoints or backend functionality.

The visual design system, animations, and UI polish are implemented entirely on the frontend using the existing API contracts from other features.
